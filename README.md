## Local Development

### First Time Setup

1. Go to https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install/windows and install the SDK.
2. Unzip it somewhere and update your PATH variable to include the full path to the `flutter/bin` folder.
3. Install the Flutter extension for VSCode by Dart Code.
4. Install Android Studio from https://developer.android.com/studio, then open it to install the Android SDK components.
5. Run `flutter doctor` in your terminal to check for anything else needed for setup.
